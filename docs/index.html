    <p>Mōb (short for "mōbility") is a highly-effective movement system designed by sports chiropractor, Dr. Patrick K. Silva, to restore and enhance functional mobility - no sweat or equipment required. The Mōb system utilizes simple, easy-to-use body hacks to quickly identify and improve common mobility issues. Whether office worker or athlete, Mōb will help you develop a firm understanding of your own musculoskeletal and myofascial health, and give you tools that you will be able to use for the rest of your life.</p>

    <p>Everybody’s got something, maybe it’s a tight low back, an old shoulder injury, a pinchy hip, tight and restless calves, or a tough time checking our blind spot - none are exempt from our body wanting to tighten up on us. We all live different lives differently - some mostly sit and stare at a screen, some are constantly pushing, pulling, and lifting, and some are always on the go. In either case, our bodies are constantly trying to adapt to our behaviors, our positions, our activities, and our injuries. Inevitably, the more stresses we put our body through, the less functional mobility we end up with - less range of motion in our joints, more compensatory tightness, poor movement quality, usually more discomfort….and the cycle continues from there. Luckily for us, some wonderfully smart doctors, researchers, trainers, and therapists throughout the ages have been keen observers of the human condition, and have come up with some brilliant solutions for these issues. Mōb is a love letter to those inventive souls, and a summary of their simplest and most effective solutions.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="mobbodytext"><b><u>THE 3 FUNDAMENTALS</u></b></span></h2>
    <p>
      There are a lot of very powerful and comprehensive movement systems out there, but Mōb takes a unique stance in its approach to teaching mobility with 3 fundamental requirements:
      <br />
      1. Keep it simple.<br />
      2. Keep it short.<br />
      3. Notice a difference.
    </p>

    <h4 class="w3-center w3-padding-24"><span class="mobbodytext"><b><u>KEEP IT SIMPLE</u></b></span></h4>
    <p>Mōb isn’t about feeding you complex systems to get you to do the splits, a handstand, or to perfect a squat or deadlift, it’s all about functional mobility - clearing out mobility barriers that are sitting between you and some of your favorite activities. Sitting, standing, laying on your back, taking the stairs, going for a run, throwing a ball, hitting the gym...all of these are higher and higher levels of functional mobility that would not be possible if individual joints or soft tissues aren’t able to keep up with the rest of your body’s demands. Mōb keeps it simple by making the foundation of your functional mobility pyramid strong.</p>
    <br /> 

    <h4 class="w3-center w3-padding-24"><span class="mobbodytext"><b><u>KEEP IT SHORT</u></b></span></h4>
    <p>As the great Kimberly Wilkins once said, “Ain’t nobody got time for that.” We know you’re busy, so Mōb was designed to be additive to your life, not subtractive. Choose what works for you - do you have 30 seconds to spot check? 1 min between meetings? 3 minutes as a warm up? 10 minutes to spare before your day starts? The quick cultivated routines or individual “mōbs” easily fit into your busy life, which only serves to further your functional mobility goals. After all, if you actually do the exercise, you’re more likely to see the results!  </p>
    <br />

    <h4 class="w3-center w3-padding-24"><span class="mobbodytext"><b><u>NOTICE A DIFFERENCE</u></b></span></h4>
    <p>Just like in clinic, my goal is to always see at least a 50% difference after treatment. If I’m not hitting that goal, it usually means I’m using the wrong tool for the job. There’s always something better and more effective, which is why Mōb’s standards are so high - if the technique or paradigm wasn’t effective enough, it’s not a part of the system. If you’ve tried any of the Mōb routines or individual exercises, you’ll likely see and feel noticeable improvements in the areas you target. Are these improvements just temporary? Heck no - we’re going for lasting change here that you can build upon, which is never difficult if you use the right tool for the right job. That’s the Mōb difference.</p>

    <hr class="horizontalbreak">

    <h2 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="mobbodytext"><b><u>THE FOUNDATIONS AND PRINCIPLES</u></b></span></h2>
    <p>Mobility refers to the ability to be moved freely and easily. With overuse, repetitive stress, overt injury, or just poor postural patterns, our bodies can get tight and locked down. These limitations in movement begin in the joints and surrounding soft tissues as fascial adhesion or scar tissue build up. Our movement system specifically targets these tissues to quickly and safely help return your body to a mobile and functional state!</p>
    <p>Injury Prevention is simply the process of addressing common issues that lead to injury. Prevention, mitigation, injury avoidance, rehab, prehab, performance enhancement, maintenance, and recovery all fall along the same spectrum. For most humans, a lack of mobility is the biggest cause of secondary musculoskeletal issues down the road, such as sprains, strains, other pains!</p>
    
    <h2 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="mobbodytext"><b><u>THE TECHNIQUES</u></b></span></h2>
    <p>P.N.F. is a bodyhack that works from a neuromuscular angle to create change in length/tension relationships throughout analogous systems (myofascial, musculoskeletal, etc.).</p>
    <p><b>Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation</b> comes in many forms, but Mōb specifically utilizes 'Autogenic Inhibition' to intentionally trick our muscles into relaxing as we make lasting changes to the surrounding fascia that usually entraps them and keeps them tight. An incredibly powerful and easy-to-replicate technique.</p>
    <p><b>Positional Breath</b>, AKA “Openers”, help create a super-stretch opportunity for the body when myofascial chains and joints are already at tension, compounding the stretch and acting as a force multiplier during specific movements in the MOB TBM system. As simple as finding a good stretch, and taking a deep breath to let the tissues around your core accommodate to this new position. Best used with fascial lines that are deeply affected by the rib excursion of a normal, healthy breath.</p>
    <p><b>Triplanar Movement</b> is the true key to healthy joint and soft tissue mobility. In the Mōb system, this is usually expressed through drawing “Shapes”, which can help avoid the pitfalls of only mobilizing or strengthening tissues in one or two planes. Think of a cyclist who’s now expected to play dodgeball or row a canoe - their body may be too adapted to the sagittal plane, and less comfortable or suited to complex rotational movements. These exercises ultimately promote a more functional testing of the musculoskeletal system.</p>
    <p><b>Coordination and balance</b> drills incorporated throughout the MOB system fill in the functional gaps that can be created even when mobilization and strengthening drills are performed at a high level. Keep in mind, just because you may have the mobility, doesn’t mean you can fully use that mobility!</p>
